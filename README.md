# PLZ HALP

## Why?
- Notion's search sucks.
- There's valuable things outside of Notion

## How?
- Type anything that means something to you, couple words, a question, etc.

## How can I halp?
- `resources.json`
- If there's something missing, add it.
- If you searched for something and it didn't come up, add the tag or question to the right resource.
